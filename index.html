        <p> I am Elena Karampetsou and I am a greek student who came in Nantes as an Erasmus student. I did not love coding back to Greece, but I do love it right now. </p>

        <h2> Passions<i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i> </h2>
        <p> One of my passions is music, I listen to music 24/7 because it boosts my mood and usually it provokes me feelings. I really love sports, because I was a gymnast and I would also like to run my own gym or pilates studio. Last but not least, I am really interested in exploring each corner of the earth and I think that my Erasmus experience is a good way to visit as many places as possible.  </p>

        <h2> What do I miss from Greece <i class="fa-solid fa-pizza-slice"></i></h2>
        <p> Everyone is asking me if I choosed coming in Nantes for its weather, and obviously the answear is not, because I miss Greece's sun. I also feel homesick sometimes and I am thinking about my mum's food. </p>

        <h2> Projects </h2>
        <p>I am currently studying in the department of Science management and technology of the Athens Uniniversity of Business and Economics. I participated in an voluntary oragnization in 2022, which is named TEDxAUEB, and I had the duties of an social media manager. Lastly, this year I was an waitress back to my country and I strongly believe that I learned more things about the people into that workplace than I did during the 12 years oin my school. </p>
